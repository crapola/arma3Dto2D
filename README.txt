Arma3Dto2D
==========

A quick script to convert empty vehicles/objects from the Arma 2 3D editor to a 2D editor format.
Objects in the air will get a setPos in their init to set the height.
Run the script with your mission.sqf in its root and output.txt will be generated.
You will need to paste the result in an existing .sqm of same island under the "class Vehicles" section and make sure items are properly numbered, and that the value for "items=" is correct.
